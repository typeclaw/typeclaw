// `skip_response` is the structured alternative to ending a turn with the
// `NO_REPLY` text sentinel. The model invokes it when it has decided not
// to send a user-facing reply but has a meaningful reason (`no new info`,
// `user asked me to stay silent`, `subagent result duplicates an earlier
// reply`, etc.). The reason lands in `typeclaw logs -f` so the operator
// can audit silent turns; the channel router suppresses the assistant
// text recovery for the current turn so nothing ever reaches the chat.
//
// This is intentionally NOT a replacement for `NO_REPLY`. The text
// sentinel remains the fallback for cases where the model cannot or will
// not call a tool (degraded provider, structured-output disabled, etc.).
// `skip_response` is preferred whenever the model has a reason worth
// recording. See session-origin.ts for the prompt-level decision rule.
//
// Order-dependence with `channel_reply`/`channel_send` is asymmetric:
//   - skip BEFORE any send → commits to silence; the router rejects any
//     subsequent tool-source send this turn with `SKIP_RESPONSE_LOCK_ERROR`.
//   - skip AFTER a send → accepted as a terminal no-op (`recorded-after-send`).
//     The earlier reply stands; this posts nothing and ends the turn. Rejecting
//     it (the old behavior) drove a livelock: denied a clean silent exit, the
//     model re-sent, got re-denied on the next skip, and repeated to the cap.
