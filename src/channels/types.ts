// stores them and lets channel tools look them up by `id` so the agent can
// fetch / view a specific attachment without ever seeing the underlying
// platform-side `ref` (URL, file id, CDN key) in its prompt context.
//
// Design contract:
// - `id` is a 1-based index that is stable WITHIN A SINGLE inbound message
//   and assigned by the adapter classifier. It is NOT globally unique —
//   different inbounds re-use small ids (1, 2, ...). The router's lookup
//   scopes the search to one (adapter,workspace,chat,thread) session and
//   returns the MOST RECENT match across that session's promptQueue +
//   contextBuffer, so within a single turn the agent always resolves
//   `attachment_id: 1` to the attachment on the current inbound — earlier
//   uses of id 1 from buffered context cannot intercept the lookup.
// - `ref` is the opaque platform handle that the adapter's
//   FetchAttachmentCallback knows how to download (Slack file id, Discord
//   CDN URL, KakaoCDN URL, Telegram file_id). It is INTENTIONALLY not
//   rendered into the user-visible prompt text — keeping it out of the
//   LLM's context prevents the dialect-confusion bug where the agent
//   pastes a malformed ref (e.g. a KakaoCDN bare key) into a tool.
// - The kind labels (photo/video/...) are coarse on purpose: they exist
//   for the prompt placeholder ("an image arrived") and for tool routing,
//   not for platform-specific behavior.
