      //      burned its budget thinking and produced nothing (the canonical
      //      kimi `stopReason: 'length'` / `aborted` degeneration). Re-prompt up

      //      while-loop re-runs session.prompt() against the same branch.
      //
      // The legitimate empty-state case (a TUI-only check before any user

  // instruction and reply to it (e.g. "Understood, I'll stop here"). The
  // bracketed marker plus the explicit "Do not acknowledge or reply to
  // this notice" line is the trust boundary that prevents this. New
  // runtime notices (rate-limit, schema-mismatch, abort signals, etc.)
  // MUST follow this convention.

  // `renderSubagentCompletionReminder` in

// Walks the session branch backward from the leaf to find a recoverable
// assistant message — i.e., text the user should see but didn't, because the
// model failed to call `channel_reply`/`channel_send` before its turn ended.
//
// Four recovery shapes:
//
//   - source: 'leaf'
//     The leaf entry IS an assistant message with `stopReason === 'stop'`.
//     The model finished its turn with visible text but never called a channel
//     tool. Pre-existing behavior; this is what the historical
//     `latestAssistantText` covered.
//
//   - source: 'length-leaf'
//     The leaf IS an assistant message with `stopReason === 'length'` — the
//     model hit the output cap, typically after interleaving reasoning past the
//     budget, but its text blocks usually hold a complete answer. Returned raw;
//     validateChannelTurn strips leaked `<think>` spans and posts the remainder
//     only if a real reply survives, else diverts to the raised-budget retry.
//     Observed against claude on a channel turn that fell silent (2026-06-12).
//
//   - source: 'mid-turn'
//     The leaf IS an assistant message with `stopReason === 'toolUse'` that
//     carries visible text. The model narrated a user-facing reply ("on it,
//     bumping to 16x now") AND committed to a tool plan in the same message,
//     but the turn ended before any follow-up assistant message that would
//     have called `channel_reply` was persisted — the upstream pi-agent-core
//     loop's post-tool follow-up never landed, or the run was aborted
//     mid-loop. The model treated its visible prose as ambient narration; in
//     a channel session that prose is dead text. Recovers it so the user gets
//     the reply the model thought it had already given. Observed against
//     Fireworks' `kimi-k2p6-turbo` on KakaoTalk: the agent posted speed-change
//     status as narration, kept taking screenshots, and the user saw nothing.
//     This is the leaf-is-assistant twin of the 'pre-tool' shape below.
//
//   - source: 'pre-tool'
//     The leaf is a `toolResult` and the immediately-prior assistant message
//     has `stopReason === 'toolUse'` (it called the tool that produced this
//     toolResult). The upstream pi-agent-core loop SHOULD have made a
//     follow-up LLM call after the tool returned, but that call either never
//     happened or produced no persisted message. Recovers the assistant's
//     pre-tool commentary so the user gets *something* — observed against
//     Fireworks' `accounts/fireworks/routers/kimi-k2p6-turbo` on 2026-05-26.
//
// Returns null when no recovery is appropriate:
//   - No leaf, no messages in branch, branch is malformed
//   - Leaf is an assistant with `stopReason` of 'error' / 'aborted' and is NOT
//     preceded by a toolResult pattern — we don't recover an upstream provider
//     failure ('error') or a terminal-reply abort ('aborted'); neither is a
//     deliberate reply. ('length' IS recovered now — see 'length-leaf' above.)
//   - Leaf is a user/system message (model hasn't responded yet)
//
// `visibleAssistantText` returning '' (empty string) is a valid recovery
// target — the caller's downstream guards (`endsWithNoReplySignal('')` returns
// true) handle the no-content case explicitly via the `no_reply` log.
