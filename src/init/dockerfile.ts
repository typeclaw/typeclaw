// `typeclaw.json#network.blockInternal` is a runtime toggle (re-run
// `typeclaw restart`) and not an image rebuild.
//
// On Debian trixie the single `iptables` package ships both the IPv4 nft
// frontend (`iptables-nft`, available as `iptables` through
// update-alternatives) and the IPv6 nft frontend (`ip6tables-nft`, available
// as `ip6tables`). The standalone `iptables-nft`/`ip6tables-nft` package
// names do NOT exist on trixie — `apt install iptables-nft` fails with
// "Unable to locate package". The shim invokes `iptables` and `ip6tables`
// which alternatives resolves to the nft variants.
//
// `util-linux` carries `setpriv`, which the shim uses to drop CAP_NET_ADMIN
// from the bounding set before exec'ing the agent. Listed first in the
// apt-get install line so the package set is self-documenting at a glance.
//
// xvfb is intentionally NOT in baseline — it's a toggle (`xvfb: true` by
// default, opt-out via `docker.file.xvfb: false`) because the shim
// self-heals: it spawns Xvfb (and exports DISPLAY) if the binary is on
// PATH, and execs the agent directly otherwise. See APT_FEATURES.xvfb
// below and `buildEntrypointShim`.
// `bubblewrap` ships the `bwrap(1)` setuid-less namespace sandboxer. It is
// included in baseline (not behind a toggle) because per-tool sandboxing of
// agent bash calls is a runtime concern resolved by the agent, not by the
// agent author. See `src/sandbox/` for the bwrap command builder, and
// `docs/internals/sandbox.mdx` for why bwrap is the right
// shape for per-call isolation inside an already-containerized agent. The
// outer container's `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined` (added in the same
// commit as this line; see `src/container/start.ts:planStart`) is what lets
// bwrap create user/pid/mount namespaces from inside Docker. Without that
// flag the seccomp default profile blocks `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)` and bwrap
// fails at startup. The two changes are load-bearing together — do not drop
// one without the other.
//
// `jq` is in baseline (not behind a toggle) so it is available to the
// per-tool bwrap sandbox that wraps agent bash calls. The sandbox only
// `--ro-bind`s `/usr` + `/bin` from the container (see `src/sandbox/build.ts`),
// so a binary that is not in the base image is invisible inside the sandbox —
// there is no per-call install path. JSON munging in one-shot read-only
// pipelines (`curl ... | jq`, `cat foo.json | jq`) is a baseline expectation
// for the explorer/reviewer/scout subagents, whose prompts already advertise
// `jq` as an available pipeline tool, so it ships unconditionally rather than
// as an opt-in toggle.

//   the TypeClaw CLI entry directly (see TYPECLAW_CLI_ENTRY). Identical
//   observable behavior to a container without this feature. This is the
//   opt-out path for users who set `network.blockInternal: false` in their
//   `typeclaw.json`.
//
//   on (default, env = "1" via `network.blockInternal: true`): walks IPv4 +
//   IPv6 block lists and installs
//   REJECT rules in the OUTPUT chain. Loopback (`-o lo`) is ACCEPT'd first
//   so dev-server dogfooding still works. The hostd HTTP control port on
//   `host.docker.internal` is re-allowed at runtime — narrowly, single
//   TCP destport, only when hostd is configured — so the agent's `restart`
//   tool can still reach the daemon. The shim then drops CAP_NET_ADMIN
//   from the bounding set AND from the inheritable + ambient sets via
//   setpriv before exec'ing the agent. Bounding set is the hard ceiling
//   enforced by execve; inheritable + ambient are cleared defensively to
//   match setpriv(1)'s explicit warning about not dropping the bounding
//   set alone.
//
// Carve-out is intentionally narrow: ACCEPT only `tcp --dport <hostd-port>`
// to the host gateway, never the gateway IP wholesale. Without the dport
// scope, a compromised agent could reach any host service via
// `host.docker.internal:22` (SSH), `:53` (DNS), `:5432` (postgres), etc.
// The gateway IP itself sits inside `172.16.0.0/12`, which the IPv4 reject
// rules below DROP — the narrow ACCEPT here is the only path through.
// When hostd is not configured (`TYPECLAW_HOSTD_URL` unset or unparseable),
// nothing is ACCEPT'd: the agent loses self-restart capability but the
// rest of the egress filter still works.
//
// IPv4-only carve-out uses `getent ahostsv4` to force the resolver into
// the A-record path. Without this, `getent hosts` would return whichever
// family the resolver prefers, and on systems that prefer AAAA we'd feed
// a v6 address to `iptables` and crash under `set -e`. host.docker.internal
// resolves to a bridge gateway that is IPv4-only on every Docker runtime
// we support (Docker Desktop, OrbStack, Docker on Linux with the
// `--add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway` flag typeclaw injects).
//
// REJECT (not DROP) so the agent fails fast with an ICMP unreachable
// instead of hanging on a 30-second connect timeout — much friendlier
// debug UX and identical security posture.
//
// `set -eu` propagates rule-install failures up to PID 1 exit, which kills
// the container. Failing closed is the right thing: an unenforced
// blockInternal=true is worse than blockInternal=false.
//
// Carve-out ordering is load-bearing. iptables OUTPUT is first-match-wins,
// and we use -A (append). So the order written into the shim is the order
// rules will be evaluated:
//   1. ESTABLISHED,RELATED ACCEPT (return path for any connection initiated
//      from outside the container — see comment block below)
//   2. loopback ACCEPT
//   3. hostd port ACCEPT (narrow: tcp + single dport on the host gateway)
//   4. resolver ACCEPT (narrow: udp/tcp dport 53 to each /etc/resolv.conf
//      nameserver) — gated on TYPECLAW_NETWORK_AUTO_ALLOW_RESOLVERS=1
//   5. user-supplied allowlist ACCEPT (wholesale: -d <cidr>) — driven by
//      TYPECLAW_NETWORK_ALLOW comma-separated env
//   6. RFC1918 + link-local + CGNAT + multicast + reserved REJECTs
// A resolver at 10.0.0.2 hits (4) and ACCEPTs before (6) DROPs it.
//
// Rule 1 (conntrack ESTABLISHED,RELATED) is what makes Docker port-forward
// reply traffic survive the RFC1918 REJECT. On Docker Desktop and OrbStack
// the bridge gateway is in 192.168.0.0/16 (OrbStack: 192.168.215.1 or
// 192.168.139.1; Docker Desktop: 192.168.65.1). A host -> container request
// via `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:HOST:CONTAINER` arrives at the container
// from the bridge gateway IP. Without rule 1, the reply packets would
// match rule 6 (192.168.0.0/16 REJECT) and never reach the host — TCP
// handshake completes (kernel SYN/ACK is in INPUT, not OUTPUT), the
// request body is delivered, but the agent's HTTP response is dropped at
// OUTPUT. Symptom: `curl http://127.0.0.1:HOST` connects but receives
// zero bytes and times out. Stateful inversion via conntrack is the
// canonical fix: ESTABLISHED matches packets belonging to a connection
// the kernel already tracks (including the inbound port-forward), and
// RELATED covers ICMP error packets for those connections. No new
// outbound capability is granted — a compromised agent still cannot
// initiate connections to RFC1918, only respond to inbound ones.
//
// Requires the `xt_conntrack` kernel module (universal on Linux 2.6.20+
// and on every Docker/OrbStack VM kernel) and the userspace iptables
// `conntrack` match (shipped in the `iptables` Debian package on trixie
// alongside the binary itself; no extra apt install needed).
//
// The resolver carve-out reads /etc/resolv.conf inside the container, NOT
// on the host. Docker propagates the host's resolver into the container by
// default (Docker Desktop and OrbStack rewrite it to the embedded DNS
// proxy at 127.0.0.11; Docker on Linux copies the host's resolv.conf
// verbatim unless --dns is passed). On Docker Desktop / OrbStack the
// nameserver is loopback and the rule is a no-op (loopback is already
// ACCEPT'd by rule 1). On native Linux + EC2/GCE/Azure VMs, the
// nameserver is the VPC resolver inside RFC1918 — exactly the case this
// carve-out targets.
//
// `awk '/^nameserver/{print $2}'` extracts only the IP, skipping
// comments, `search`, `options`, and malformed lines. We don't validate
// the IP further: a malformed nameserver line would have crashed glibc's
// resolver long before the shim ran, so we trust resolv.conf's contents.
// IPv6 nameservers (rare in practice, never the case on EC2/GCE/Azure)
// are skipped by `grep -v ':'` to avoid feeding a v6 address to iptables.
// `iptables -C` (check) is intentionally NOT used to dedupe — duplicate
// ACCEPT rules are harmless (still first-match-wins), and the check
// flag's exit code is hard to reason about under `set -e`.
//
// The user-supplied allowlist (TYPECLAW_NETWORK_ALLOW) is splat on
// commas. Each entry is fed directly to iptables -d, which accepts both
// bare IPs and CIDR notation. Validation already happened in config.ts at
// parse time, so the shim trusts the env. Empty env → loop body never
// runs, zero ACCEPT rules added.

# start_xvfb launches Xvfb in the background under a stripped capability
# bounding set so headed Chrome (agent-browser --headed, Playwright
# headful) has a real X11 display to connect to. Headless containers
# have no display server; Chrome --headless / --headless=new is
# fingerprinted by modern bot detection (Akamai / Cloudflare BM)
# regardless of UA spoof, so real headed Chrome under a virtual
# framebuffer is the only path to a passing sensor score from a
# server-side container.
#
# Two correctness invariants this function enforces:
#
# 1. Xvfb never holds CAP_NET_ADMIN. The shim runs as PID 1 with the
#    container's full capability set (including NET_ADMIN when
#    network.blockInternal=true). If we backgrounded Xvfb naked, it
#    would inherit NET_ADMIN and keep it for the container's lifetime
#    — defeating the capability-drop contract that setpriv applies to
#    the agent process. Routing Xvfb through the same setpriv invocation
#    we use for the agent strips NET_ADMIN before Xvfb's first exec.
#    On the off-path (blockInternal=false) the bounding-set drop is a
#    no-op (NET_ADMIN was never granted), but the call is harmless.
#
# 2. Xvfb startup failure is loud, not silent. \`Xvfb ... >/dev/null &\`
#    under \`set -e\` does not fail the script if Xvfb exits immediately
#    (missing library, port conflict, malformed args). Without the
#    explicit liveness probe below, the shim would then export DISPLAY
#    and exec bun, agent-browser launches would die with "cannot open
#    display", and the operator would chase a phantom bug. A monitor
#    subshell owns Xvfb, \`wait\`s for it, and drops a status file the
#    instant it exits; the poll loop checks that file (before the socket
#    check) so an early exit becomes a clear stderr line and a non-zero
#    shim exit.
#
#    We do NOT probe liveness with \`kill -0 "\$xvfb_pid"\`. A backgrounded
#    child that exits before the shell \`wait\`s for it becomes a zombie,
#    and \`kill -0\` returns success on a zombie PID (it still exists in
#    the process table). Under load the shell reaps the zombie lazily, so
#    \`kill -0\` reported the dead Xvfb as alive for up to the full 3s
#    window — the loop then timed out and printed the misleading "did not
#    create socket within 3s" diagnostic instead of "exited immediately".
#    The status-file handshake sidesteps zombie semantics entirely.
#
# We DO NOT use \`xvfb-run\`. xvfb-run hangs forever when it runs as
# PID 1 inside a container: its SIGUSR1-based ready handshake races
# and stalls because PID 1 ignores signals without explicit handlers,
# so the \`trap : USR1 ; wait || :\` dance never wakes up. Observed in
# practice: container alive, Xvfb running, PID 1 stuck in
# \`rt_sigsuspend\`, no agent process ever spawns, \`docker logs\` empty.
# Documented industry workarounds are tini-as-PID-1 or direct Xvfb
# spawn; we pick the latter (no new dep).

# link_persistent_home_files symlinks credential files that tools write
# to $HOME into a bind-mounted location so they survive container
# restarts. The container's $HOME (/root by default) lives on Docker's
# writable overlay and is wiped on every \`stop\`+\`start\` cycle, so
# without this symlink the operator would have to re-paste credentials
# after every restart.
#
# Two files are linked today, both following the same contract:
#   - ~/.codex/auth.json — Codex CLI rotates OAuth tokens in place by
#     rewriting auth.json with refreshed credentials.
#   - $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.credentials.json, or ~/.claude/.credentials.json
#     by default — Claude Code rotates OAuth tokens in place by rewriting
#     .credentials.json on every successful refresh (anthropics/claude-code
#     #53063). Linux/Windows path; macOS uses the Keychain entry "Claude
#     Code-credentials" with the same JSON shape.
#
# The persist root lives under /agent/.typeclaw/home/ (bind-mounted
# from the agent folder via the -v <cwd>:/agent flag in start.ts).
# Namespacing under .typeclaw/ keeps the agent's top-level layout clean and reserves
# a system-owned subtree we can extend later (e.g. ~/.gemini/) without
# colliding with user files. The directory is gitignored by buildGitignore()
# so credentials never enter history.
#
# Three invariants this function enforces:
#
# 1. Symlink is unconditional and idempotent. We never check whether
#    auth.json exists before linking — \`ln -sfn\` creates a dangling
#    symlink on first boot, and the first \`codex login\` write goes
#    through it to land at the persistent location. -f replaces an
#    existing symlink; -n stops ln from dereferencing into a directory
#    if a previous container life happened to write a real ~/.codex/
#    dir before this code shipped.
#
# 2. We symlink credential FILES for tools whose config dirs are mostly
#    scratch/history (Codex, Claude). We do not redirect global config
#    locations such as XDG_CONFIG_HOME or ~/.config here because tools like
#    git also read config from those paths; first-party bundles that need
#    persistence should set their own app-specific env vars instead.
#
# 3. We mkdir -p the target's parent on every boot. /agent is bind-
#    mounted, so the host-side path may exist or not depending on
#    whether the operator ever started the container before this code
#    shipped. mkdir -p is idempotent and cheap.
#
# 4. The root is overridable via TYPECLAW_PERSIST_HOME_ROOT, which only
#    the shim's executable tests set. Production never sets it, so the
#    in-container path is always /agent/.typeclaw/home/. The override
#    lets the shim's behavioral tests verify symlink semantics against
#    a real tmpdir on the host without touching /agent (which doesn't
#    exist on developer machines and CI runners).

// Layer 7: install @huggingface/transformers with its linux-native binaries.
//
// The host node_modules is bind-mounted over /agent at runtime carrying
// whatever binaries the host (typically macOS) resolved, so this layer seeds
// LINUX binaries into an image path that survives the bind mount and still
// wins Node/Bun resolution. Two native-dep mechanisms, fixed differently:
//
//   1. onnxruntime-node ships its addon via a POSTINSTALL that materializes the
//      binary inside the package dir, so a plain `bun add` covers it.
//   2. sharp resolves its native code from SEPARATE `@img/sharp-*` optional
//      PACKAGES, not a postinstall addon. sharp is a MANDATORY dep of
//      transformers, loaded eagerly because the package main chains
//      transformers.js -> utils/image.js (top-level `import sharp`) even though
//      typeclaw only does text feature-extraction. `bun add
//      @huggingface/transformers` alone does NOT pull the linux `@img/*` when
//      the bind-mounted host tree already satisfies sharp with the macOS ones —
//      so `sharp.js` throws at import ("Could not load the sharp module using
//      the linux-<arch> runtime") and the container exits at startup. We
//      install the arch-matched linux platform packages EXPLICITLY to fix it.
//
// CRITICAL — install location. `typeclaw start` bind-mounts the host agent
// folder over /agent at runtime (`-v <cwd>:/agent`), so anything written under
// /agent/node_modules at BUILD time is MASKED at runtime and can never win.
// The prior fix ran this `bun add` under `WORKDIR /agent`, populating
// /agent/node_modules — invisible behind the bind mount, so the sharp crash
// persisted. We install from `WORKDIR /` instead: the linux packages land in
// the IMAGE's /node_modules, which is NOT masked by the /agent mount. Node/Bun
// resolution for `require('@img/sharp-linux-<arch>')` ascends from
// /agent/node_modules/sharp up the directory chain and finds /node_modules,
// so the linux binary resolves. WORKDIR is restored to /agent afterwards so
// later layers and the runtime CWD are unchanged.
//
// EXACT transformers version this image installs. Must stay in lockstep with
// `@huggingface/transformers` in the repo package.json (a guard test in
// dockerfile.test.ts asserts the two agree). The pin is EXACT — not a caret —
// because this layer's `bun add` runs at `WORKDIR /` with NO project lockfile,
// so the repo `bun.lock` does NOT constrain it. A bare `@huggingface/
// transformers` (no version) would resolve npm `latest` at BUILD time: the day
// a newer transformers ships, the container would install it while the
// sharp/libvips pins below stay fixed, and the mismatched sharp platform
// packages crash at container import ("Could not load the sharp module using
// the linux-<arch> runtime"). Pinning the version closes that drift.
export const TRANSFORMERS_VERSION = '4.2.0'

// TRANSFORMERS_VERSION, `sharp@`, `@img/sharp-linux-*`, and
// `@img/sharp-libvips-linux-*` together — mismatched sharp/libvips platform
// packages are a known failure mode.
//
// ARCH DETECTION — uname -m, not $TARGETARCH. Deriving the arch from the build
// arg as `${TARGETARCH:-amd64}` was a footgun: a bare `docker build` without
// BuildKit/buildx leaves TARGETARCH unset, so the default installed x64 packages
// even on arm64 hosts. The arm64 platform packages then exist in NEITHER
// /agent/node_modules/@img NOR /node_modules/@img, so sharp exhausts every
// candidate and aborts with a clean MODULE_NOT_FOUND ("Could not load the sharp
// module using the linux-arm64 runtime") the moment any code touches it (e.g.
// `typeclaw --help`). `uname -m` is the arch that actually runs this `bun add`

// Claude Code's official installer is `curl | bash`, not apt — can't live
// in APT_FEATURES. Layer placed after the toggle apt install (so curl + ca-
// certificates from the baseline are guaranteed present) and before the
// entrypoint shim (which is always last). Omitted entirely when disabled.
//
// The Anthropic installer drops `claude` at `$HOME/.local/bin/claude` and
// emits a "~/.local/bin is not in your PATH" warning on every install on
// bun:1-slim (PATH out of the box is `/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/
// sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/local/bun-node-fallback-bin`, no
// `~/.local/bin`). Without intervention, every `which claude` from the
// agent (and from the typeclaw-claude-code skill's verification step)
// returns empty. Symlink into `/usr/local/bin/` — already on PATH, matches
// what `cloudflared` does, survives `/root/.local/bin` getting rewritten
// by the installer's "update" path. The symlink resolves to the
// `~/.local/bin/claude` shim, which itself dereferences to the versioned
// binary under `~/.local/share/claude/versions/<ver>/`, so upgrades via
// `claude update` keep working without re-running this layer.
// `~/.claude.json` is Claude Code's internal state file (NOT
// `~/.claude/settings.json`, which is user-facing). On first run with an
// empty or missing file, `claude` enters a TTY-only theme picker:
// "Welcome to Claude Code … Choose the text style that looks best with
// your terminal" with 7 options. The picker is unskippable via CLI
// flags or env vars (no `--skip-onboarding`, no `--theme=dark`;
// `IS_DEMO=1` exists but has documented side effects). The single
// official escape hatch is writing `{"hasCompletedOnboarding": true,
// "theme": "dark"}` to `~/.claude.json` before the first launch —
// confirmed by Anthropic in multiple GitHub issues
// (anthropics/claude-code#4714, #8938, #13827) and the empirical
// answer used by metabase/metabase's `bin/claude-dangerous`, the
// `claudeCodeAlDevContainer` feature, and dozens of other Docker
// integrations.
//
// Without the pre-seed, the very first agent-driven `tmux new-session …
// claude` invocation hangs on the theme picker: the agent's
// `send-keys "<prompt>" Enter` arrives at the picker, gets interpreted
// as picker input, and never reaches claude's actual prompt. The
// `typeclaw-claude-code` skill is structured around a `Stop`-hook
// sentinel, which never fires while the picker is up, so the polling
// loop only learns of the hang at the 10-minute wall-clock budget.
// Pre-seeding here costs ~85 bytes on disk and zero runtime overhead.
//
// SCOPE: this seed is NECESSARY but not SUFFICIENT for a fully
// no-questions-asked first launch. Claude Code also shows two
// post-seed modal dialogs that this file deliberately does NOT
// pre-clear:
//   1. "Detected a custom API key from environment. Do you want to use
//      this API key?" — fires when ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set. Options
//      `[No (recommended), Yes]`, focus on No, picker does NOT wrap.
//   2. Workspace trust ("Do you trust the files in this folder?") —
//      fires on every new cwd. Options `[Yes, proceed, No, exit]`,
//      focus on Yes.
// Both are kept as runtime decisions handled by the
// `typeclaw-claude-code` skill (see its "Driving the session" section,
// "Clear startup dialogs" step, which uses dialog-specific keystrokes
// because the picker doesn't wrap). Pre-seeding
// `hasTrustDialogAccepted` or `customApiKeyResponses.approved` here
// would silently widen the trust surface in ways the operator hasn't
// consented to — the seed's job is strictly cosmetic-wizard removal,
// not trust/permission preemption.
//
// `theme: "dark"` matches typeclaw's default TUI theme so the visual
// transition between the typeclaw TUI and a tmux-attached claude pane
// is consistent. Users on light terminals can override by editing
// `~/.claude.json` (which persists across container restarts only if
// they mount it; in the default container-ephemeral state it resets
// to this default on every rebuild, which is fine — `claude` reads
// the file at startup and the theme has no behavioral impact).
//
// `lastOnboardingVersion` is INTENTIONALLY OMITTED. ii-agent and a
// few other templates ship `lastOnboardingVersion: "1.0.30"`, but
// that value is version-coupled and goes stale on every Claude Code
// release. Empirically against Claude Code 2.1.146, the current
// `hasCompletedOnboarding: true` alone is honored without a version
// pin. If a future Claude version starts re-triggering the picker
// when the field is missing, capture `claude --version` output at
// build time and inject it then — don't hardcode a stale value.
//
// `installMethod: "native"` and `numStartups: 1` match the shape
// Claude Code itself writes after a clean first launch; keeping them
// makes our seed indistinguishable from a real post-onboarding state,
// which minimizes the chance of a future "if the file looks like
// agent-pre-seed, redo onboarding" detection heuristic landing on us.
//
// Built via `JSON.stringify` rather than a hand-written string
// literal so quote/escape bugs surface as TS errors at compile time,
// not as a corrupt `~/.claude.json` discovered only when the build
// runs. The `printf '%s\\n' '<JSON>'` shell pattern relies on the
// JSON containing no single quotes (true by construction — JSON.
// stringify only emits double quotes); a regression test parses the
// emitted JSON back to confirm.
const CLAUDE_CODE_ONBOARDING_SEED = JSON.stringify({
  hasCompletedOnboarding: true,

// The Stop hook is what powers the typeclaw-claude-code skill's done-signal:
// the operator subagent spawns claude in a worktree, polls a sentinel file,
// and decides "turn done" from the file's contents. The hook was originally
// per-worktree (`<worktree>/.claude/settings.json` + `<worktree>/hook-on-
// stop.sh`), which meant the operator subagent wrote both files itself at
// delegation time. That worked when operator wrote the canonical shape —
// and silently failed when it didn't. Claude Code's settings parser
// ignores unknown keys, so wrong-shape configs (`{"hooks": {"onStop":
// "./script.sh"}}`, `{"hooks": {"Stop": "./script.sh"}}`,
// `{"hooks": {"Stop": [{"command": "./script.sh"}]}}` etc.) surface as
// "polling timed out at the 10-minute wall-clock budget" rather than as a
// parse error — the failure is invisible until you've already paid the
// budget. The skill's "do not simplify this JSON" warning helps but doesn't
// eliminate the slip: as long as an LLM has to write the JSON, an LLM can
// invent a shape.
//
// Move both pieces to Dockerfile-build time, where the JSON is constructed
// once via JSON.stringify and the shape can never drift from the operator's
// reading of the skill:
//
//   1. `/usr/local/bin/typeclaw-cc-stop-hook` — the hook script. Stable
//      absolute path so the global settings.json can name it without
//      worrying about $PATH. Reads stdin (Claude Code's Stop event JSON)
//      and atomically writes `$PWD/sentinel.json` + touches `$PWD/.done`.
//      The temp-file-then-rename keeps the read side from ever seeing a
//      partial sentinel even if the polling loop races the write — same
//      atomicity contract as the previous per-worktree script.
//   2. `~/.claude/settings.json` — the user-level (global) hook config.
//      User-level hooks fire for every `claude` invocation regardless of
//      cwd, so the operator's worktree no longer needs its own
//      `.claude/settings.json`. (Claude Code merges hooks additively
//      across scopes per docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings —
//      if a future user mounts their own `~/.claude/settings.json` with a
//      different Stop hook, both fire in parallel rather than ours being
//      clobbered.)
//
// Both files are written via JSON.stringify + heredoc; the JSON shape is
// validated by JSON.parse in dockerfile.test.ts, so a future edit that
// corrupts the structure fails the test, not the docker build (let alone
// the next delegation that runs against the broken hook). The previous
// per-worktree path is fully removed from the skill body; the only place
// the hook shape lives is here.
//
// IMPORTANT — \`$PWD\` vs \`$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\`: an earlier version of this
// layer used \`$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\`. Self-review caught this as a critical
// bug. \`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\` is Claude Code's documented env var for "the
// project root" — but empirically (see anthropics/claude-code#27343 and
// #44450), inside a git worktree it resolves to the *main repo's* git
// root, NOT the worktree's path. The operator's flow is:
//   git -C /agent worktree add /tmp/cc-<id> HEAD
//   tmux new-session -d -s cc-<id> -c /tmp/cc-<id> claude
// So \`/tmp/cc-<id>\` is a registered worktree of \`/agent\`, and Claude
// Code would resolve \`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR=/agent\` — landing the sentinel
// in the live agent folder while the polling loop watches the worktree.
//
// The fix: write to \`$PWD\` instead. \`$PWD\` is set by every POSIX shell
// on every invocation (POSIX-required since IEEE 1003.1-1988), and it's
// the literal cwd Claude Code was invoked with — exactly the worktree
// path \`tmux -c\` set. \`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\` is Anthropic-specific and
// has shifted semantics across versions per the cited bug reports; we
// deliberately avoid depending on it.
//
// PER-SESSION FILENAMES — concurrent-claude race safety: the Stop hook
// writes to \`sentinel-<session_id>.json\` and \`.done-<session_id>\`,
// not a fixed filename. session_id comes from Claude Code's Stop event
// JSON on stdin (\`BaseHookInputSchema.session_id\`, always present per
// the upstream schema). The operator learns the UUID by reading a
// \`.session-id\` file that a SessionStart hook (also baked here) writes
// at session-start time; see TYPECLAW_CC_SESSION_START_HOOK_SCRIPT
// below.
//
// The earlier shape used fixed \`sentinel.json\` + \`.done\` names, which
// is safe when each worktree has at most one claude session (today's
// only caller). But if two callers ever share a cwd — operator A and
// operator B both delegating in \`/agent\`, a future plugin that runs
// \`claude\` from a shared dir, or an out-of-band caller violating the
// "one worktree per delegation" invariant — both write to the same
// file and corrupt each other's state with no diagnostic. Per-session
// filenames make the race structurally impossible.
//
// WHY NOT \`claude --session-id <pre-generated-uuid>\`: an earlier
// iteration of this PR had the operator pre-generate a UUID and pass
// it via \`--session-id\`. Self-review caught that as a critical bug:
// per anthropics/claude-code#44607, the \`--session-id\` flag only
// controls the persistence/transcript UUID in \`-p\` (print) mode. In
// interactive mode (which the typeclaw-claude-code skill uses), the
// flag sets a separate telemetry/API ID while the CLI generates its
// own internal UUID for the transcript file and for the \`session_id\`
// field that hooks see. The pre-generated UUID and the hook's UUID
// don't match — the polling loop times out forever. The current
// design sidesteps this entirely: the operator does NOT pass
// \`--session-id\`; it lets claude generate its own UUID and learns it
// back via the \`.session-id\` file the SessionStart hook writes.
//
// session_id extraction: \`bun -e\` against the JSON payload. We use bun,
// NOT POSIX sed, because bun is guaranteed in the container (bun:1-slim
// base) and is a real JSON parser. A previous iteration used
// \`sed -n 's/.*"session_id":"\\([^"]*\\)".*/\\1/p'\` which is greedy and
// picks the LAST \`"session_id":"..."\` occurrence in the JSON.
// Claude Code's Stop event carries \`last_assistant_message\` which
// contains the assistant's prose — that prose can include the literal
// text \`"session_id":"<fake-uuid>"\` (the model might have been
// discussing session IDs!), which sed would extract instead of the
// top-level field. bun's JSON.parse picks the structural \`session_id\`
// regardless of what appears in nested string values. UUID-shape
// validation still applies downstream as defense-in-depth against
// path-traversal session_id values; malformed JSON or missing field
// falls back to "malformed" so the polling loop sees SOMETHING and
// can surface the corruption.
//
// FALLBACK FILENAMES — \`sentinel-malformed.json\` / \`.done-malformed\`:
// if session_id extraction fails or validation rejects the result, the
// hook writes to these fixed names. The operator's polling loop watches
// its own \`<sid>\` file (read from \`.session-id\`) and will time out —
// but the \`-malformed\` file exists on disk so a post-mortem inspector
// can tell "hook fired but session_id was bad" apart from "hook never
// fired at all."
//
// SECURITY/SCOPE: both hook scripts only touch files inside \`$PWD\`,
// with filenames validated to UUID shape or the fixed "malformed"
// fallback. Even with an adversarial \`session_id\` in the stdin
// payload, the worst case is "hook writes \`$PWD/sentinel-malformed.json\`"
// or "hook writes \`$PWD/.session-id\` containing 'malformed'" — never
// path traversal, never writes outside \`$PWD\`. The hooks run as root
// inside the container like every other in-container process; there is
// no privilege boundary to cross.

// IMPORTANT — \`.session-id\` is a FAST PATH, not a precondition. Per
// anthropics/claude-code#11519, SessionStart can be SKIPPED entirely
// when workspace trust hasn't been accepted yet: debug logs show
// \`Skipping SessionStart:startup hook execution - workspace trust not
// accepted\`. For the typeclaw-claude-code skill flow, EVERY first
// invocation in a fresh worktree hits this — the trust dialog fires
// before any prompt can be sent. So \`.session-id\` may never appear
// pre-first-prompt. The skill instructs the operator to fall back to
// reading session_id from the FIRST Stop hook's sentinel instead.
// \`.session-id\` is still useful for sessions that were already
// trusted (re-attaching to a running worktree, etc.) — when it
// appears, the operator can skip the discovery step.
//
// IMPORTANT — \`compact\` can ROTATE the session_id. The upstream
// behavior is documented in anthropics/claude-code#29094: a SessionStart
// with \`source: "compact"\` is a NEW session linked via
// \`parent_session_id\`. So \`.session-id\` can change mid-delegation if
// a long claude session compacts itself. The operator's polling loop
// must handle session_id rotation: a new \`.done-<different-uuid>\`

// \`bun install -g\` invariant: cache-mount keyed install, no \$HOME/.local/bin
// symlink dance, no installer scratch.
//
// Hook architecture: Codex CLI ships a hook system with the SAME event names
// as Claude Code (SessionStart, Stop, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, etc.) and the
// SAME JSON shape (\`{ session_id, transcript_path, cwd, hook_event_name }\` on
// stdin). The two CLIs are NOT interoperable — Codex's config file is
// \`~/.codex/hooks.json\` (or inline \`[hooks]\` in \`config.toml\`), and the trust
// model differs (Codex prompts for hook trust on first run, gated by
// \`--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust\`). But the hook script body, the
// per-session filenames (\`.done-<sid>\`, \`sentinel-<sid>.json\`), the
// \`.session-id\` fast path, and the \`malformed\` fallback are byte-for-byte
// reusable. We deliberately use distinct paths (\`typeclaw-cx-*\` instead of
// \`typeclaw-cc-*\`) and a distinct settings file (\`~/.codex/hooks.json\` vs
// \`~/.claude/settings.json\`) so an agent with BOTH toggles on doesn't have
// the two CLIs racing on the same sentinel files. The skill side
// (\`typeclaw-codex-cli\`) documents which UUID-bearing artifacts belong to
// which CLI.
//
// Onboarding: Codex has NO theme picker, NO telemetry consent dialog, NO
// terms-of-service prompt — verified against
// codex-rs/tui/src/onboarding/onboarding_screen.rs in the upstream repo.
// The TUI's onboarding state machine has exactly three steps: Welcome,
// Auth, TrustDirectory. We CAN'T pre-seed past Welcome (it's an animation,
// not a prompt), and we DELIBERATELY don't pre-seed past Auth (the user
// must paste their OPENAI_API_KEY or run \`codex login\` themselves) or past
// TrustDirectory (trusting an arbitrary worktree silently widens the trust
// surface in ways the operator hasn't consented to — exact same reasoning
// as Claude Code's "don't preseed hasTrustDialogAccepted"). The
// \`typeclaw-codex-cli\` skill handles all three at runtime via dialog
// polling, the same shape Claude Code's skill uses for its post-seed
// modals.

// ("headed silently ignored on existing session"): when a daemon is

// regardless of the requested mode. Three upstream fix PRs (#660, #370,
// #387) have been open and unmerged for months as of 2026-05, so we
// patch this locally rather than block on upstream.
//
// Allowlist, not denylist. The wrapper only pre-closes on the three
// commands that explicitly start a new browsing session (\`open\`,
// \`goto\`, \`navigate\`). Every other agent-browser subcommand — \`click\`,
// \`snapshot\`, \`chat\`, \`connect\`, \`batch\`, \`tab\`, \`record\`, \`trace\`,
// \`stream\`, \`cookies\`, \`network\`, ... — passes through untouched.
// Rationale: those subcommands may operate on the live browser/page
// state (cookies, in-progress recording, attached external CDP, etc.),
// and a pre-close from us would silently destroy it. The user-reported
// scenario for #1083 (\"\`agent-browser open <url> --headed\` after a
// previous headless invocation\") is fully covered because the
// follow-up commands inherit the now-headed browser the \`open\`
// pre-close forced. An earlier draft used a deny-list approach that
// pre-closed on every non-skip subcommand under headed env; oracle
// self-review flagged the state-destruction risk for stateful commands,
// and the allowlist fix is the resulting narrower contract.
//
// Truthy contract mirrors upstream's \`env_var_is_truthy\`
// (cli/src/flags.rs:183): any non-empty value EXCEPT case-insensitive
// "0" / "false" / "no" counts as truthy. So
// \`AGENT_BROWSER_HEADED=yes\`, \`=y\`, \`=on\`, \`=anything-non-falsy\` all
// trigger the workaround — matching what upstream's CLI parser would
// see — instead of the original narrower 1|true match that left the
// bug present for legitimate truthy values.
//
// Re-entrancy is defended at two layers. (1) The pre-close path is
// \`open\`/\`goto\`/\`navigate\` only, and the close subcommand isn't in the
// allowlist, so the pre-close never recurses through the wrapper into
// another pre-close. (2) \`_TYPECLAW_AGENT_BROWSER_HEADED_HANDLED=1\` is
// set on the env passed to both the pre-close and the final exec; if a
// future subcommand we don't recognize shells out to \`agent-browser\` as
// a subprocess while headed env is still set, the child sees the guard
// and bypasses straight to .real without recursing.
